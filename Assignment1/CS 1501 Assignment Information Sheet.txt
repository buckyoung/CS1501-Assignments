- Additional comments:
I did a lot of optimization for efficiency. Firstly, I utilized the TreeMap data structure which guarantees log(n) time for the get and put methods -- also TreeMap sorts itself automatically! Furthermore, I did a lot of optimization during the inner-product calculations. And finally, I used the StringTokenizer versus string.split or other possible options because of its speed. The program works as expected, though I did notice that I had one additional distinct word when parsing "dickens.txt" ... the other trial runs were perfect, though. --Thanks!
