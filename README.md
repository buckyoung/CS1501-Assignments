==================

Vector Comparator, Binary Expression Evaluator/Normalizer (Fall 2013)

###Assignment 1
Compare's the difference between two text files as the angle between their multidimensional vectors. 
Does this by tokenizing every word in each file (a word is defined as a consecutive alpha-numeric grouping 
[punctuation is ignored]), adding them to a TreeMap (automatically sorted map structure), 
and then computing the summation of their vectors and the angle between them.

###Assignment 2
Accepts a file of binary expressions (and initial truth values of each atom) and displays them as a tree. 
The expressions are then normalized (disjunctively) and evaluated according to the initial, given truth values.
